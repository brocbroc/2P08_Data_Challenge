# 2P08_Data_Challenge
This repository contains an analysis on data about crime incidents. To run the analysis, open the file Data_challenge.ipynb in Google Colab and connect it to Google Drive. Then add the data file team12_crime.csv to Google Drive and modify the third code cell to refer to the address of the data file in Google Drive. The data analysis can now be run.

The data contains reports of crime incidents, with the date, neighborhood, crime type, time of day, if it is resolved, property value, number of arrests made, and response time recorded for each incident. The questions that this data analysis seeks to answer are:
<ol>
  <li>Which neighborhood has the highest crime rate?</li>
  <li>What is the average response time by crime type?</li>
  <li>Which time of day has the most incidents?</li>
  <li>What percentage of crimes are resolved in each neighborhood?</li>
  <li>How does property value vary by crime type?</li>
  <li>Which crime type results in the most arrests?</li>
</ol>

The repository also contains a video explanation of the analysis and the findings.
